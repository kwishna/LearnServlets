Tomcat Converts JSP To Servlet. 

We Don't Need To Write HttpServletRequest Or HttpServletResponse Object. All These Are Provided By Default In JSP. So,
It Is Easy To Work With JSP.
In Servlet, We Need To Create A Class, Extend HttpServlet, Then Methods Like doGet, doPost etc. And Pass Request & Response Parameter Into It.
Then We Need To Create PrintWriter.

How JSP Is Converted Into Servlet By TomCat :-
1) demo.jsp file Name -> Converted To demo_jsp Class extends HttpServlet.
2) The Code Inside <% %> Tag Is Copied Into -> service(Req, Res) Method Of demojsp Class. (<% %> Is Called Scriptlet)
3) The Code Which Is Inside <%! %> Tag Is Copied Into -> Above The Service(Req, Res) Method. (Say, Declaration Section)
4) <%@page import="java.util.Date", "java.util.List" %> -> This Goes To import Package Place. (Directive)
5) <%= k %> -> This Goes To out.println(k); (Expression)

Syntax :
<%@ page attribute="value" session="true | false" %>
<%@ include file="something.jsp" %> : We Can Attach Another Files Using This.
<%@ taglib url="url" prefix="something" %> : We Can Attach Another Libraries For Tag. User Defined Tags

MVC -- Model View Controller
Model Means "Any POJO (Plain Old Java Object) Class. Which Has All The Operations Like DB Connection"
View Means "JSP. JSP Provides The View Using HTML. The Data Inside It Is Provided By Controller"
Controller Means "Servlet. Servlet Has The Methods. It Serves The Client Request. Provides Data Into View With The Help Of Model"

JSP Provides Following Built-In Objects. Can Be Used Directly.
a) request (HttpServletRequest)
b) response (HttpServletResponse)
c) pageContext (PageContext)
d) out (JspWriter) ~ PrintWriter Object
e) session (HttpSession)
f) application (ServletContext)
g) config (ServletConfig)

How To Handle The Exception Or Error In JSP :-
We Can Use try catch In JSP. But, It Is Not Good For Many Reasons.
We Will Create A Separate Page For Error. Called errorPage. We Will Put errorPage="error.jsp" Inside <%@ %> Tag.
Similarly, We Will Write isErrorPage="true" Inside <%@ %> Tag In error.jsp File. So That It Understand The Error.
Then Write <%= exception %> In error.jsp
